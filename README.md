# 🐱 PetFlix 🐶
Project done during the DIO HTML bootcamp, clonning the netflix page, with some personal touchs.

The real project was to clone the Netflix interface. I got the idea and impremented the interface, insteaded of aiming on Netflix catalogue, used some personal experiences with pets, to create an interface with movies, books and cartoons that I like and recommend.

It was used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuerry, MediaQuerry and more.

Will later refacturte it with more functionalities.
